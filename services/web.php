        <li><a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> the de-facto open source web server platform built by the Apache Software Foundation. Apache Foundation is
 a community of open-source software projects characterized by a collaborative, consensus based development process.</li><br>
	<li><a href="http://www.boa.org" target="_blank">Boa</a> is a single-tasking HTTP server. That means that unlike traditional web servers, it does not fork for each
 incoming connection, nor does it fork many copies of itself to handle multiple connections. It internally multiplexes all of the ongoing HTTP connections, and forks only
for CGI programs (which must be separate processes), automatic directory generation, and automatic file gunzipping. Preliminary tests show Boa is capable of handling sever
al thousand hits per second on a 300 MHz Pentium and dozens of hits per second on a lowly 20 MHz 386/SX.</li><br>
	<li><a href="http://www.cherokee-project.com/" target="_blank"> Cherokee</a> is a very fast, flexible and easy to configure Web Server. It supports the widespread technologies nowadays: FastCGI, SCGI, PHP, CGI, TLS and SSL encrypted connections, Virtual hosts, Authentication, on the fly encoding, Apache compatible log files, and much more.</li><br>

Mathopd supports useful features of HTTP/1.1, such as persistent connections, partial responses and pipelining. It does not support things like content negotation. The latest version of the software (1.5) also supports CGI/1.1.</li><br>
	<li><a href="http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/" target="_blank"> Thttpd</a> is a simple, small, portable, fast, and secure HTTP server. It handles only the minimum necessary to implement HTTP/1.1. It also has a very small run-time size, since it does not fork and is very careful about memory allocation. Thttpd compiles cleanly on most Unix like OS, specifically including FreeBSD, SUNOS 4, Solaris 2, BSD/OS, linux, OSF</li><br>
