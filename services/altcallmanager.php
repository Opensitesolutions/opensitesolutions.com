	<li><a href="http://www.asterisk.org/" target="_blank"> Asterisk</a> is an open source/free software implementation of a telephone private branch exchange (PBX) originally created by Mark Spencer of Digium. Like any PBX, it allows a number of attached telephones to make calls to one another, and to connect to other telephone services including the public switched telephone network (PSTN). "Its name comes from the asterisk symbol, *, which in Unix (and Unix-like operating systems such as Linux) and DOS environments represents a wildcard, matching any sequence of characters in a filename."  <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/091206-von-sam-houston.html?page=1">Read</a> about others who are making the switch.</li><br>
