    <li><a href="http://http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/voicesw/ps556/" target="_blank"> Cisco Call Manager </a> Cisco Unified Communications Manager (formerly Cisco Unified CallManager) is the powerful call-processing component of the Cisco Unified Communications solution. It provides voice, video, mobility, and presence services for businesses with up to 60,000 users, Unified Communications Manager is a scalable, distributable, and highly available enterprise-class IP telephony call-processing system.<br><br>

    Cisco Unified Communications Manager creates a unified workspace that extends enterprise telephony features and capabilities to packet telephony network devices such as IP phones, media processing devices, voice over IP (VoIP) gateways, mobile devices, and multimedia applications. Additional services, such as unified messaging, multimedia conferencing, presence, collaborative contact centers, and interactive multimedia response systems, are made possible through open telephony APIs.</li><br><br>

    <li><a href="http://www.asterisk.org/" target="_blank"> Asterisk</a> is an open source/free software implementation of a telephone private branch exchange (PBX) originally created by Mark Spencer of Digium. Like any PBX, it allows a number of attached telephones to make calls to one another, and to connect to other telephone services including the public switched telephone network (PSTN). "Its name comes from the asterisk symbol, *, which in Unix (and Unix-like operating systems such as Linux) and DOS environments represents a wildcard, matching any sequence of characters in a filename."  <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/091206-von-sam-houston.html?page=1">Read</a> about others who are making the switch.</li><br>
